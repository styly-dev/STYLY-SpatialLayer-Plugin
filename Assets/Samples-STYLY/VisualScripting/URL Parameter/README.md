URL Parameter Retrieval Sample

This sample demonstrates how to retrieve URL parameters when launching content in the STYLY environment. It uses a simple node structure to show the basic process.

Overview of Features
1.	Retrieving the Full URL
The Get System Info node is used to retrieve the entire URL specified at the time the content is launched.
2.	Retrieving URL Parameters
The Get URL Parameter node is used to specify a key and retrieve the corresponding value from the URL parameters.
3.	Testing with Dummy Data
This sample uses a dummy URL for testing instead of the actual URL provided by the STYLY environment. When played in STYLY, the correct URL specified at launch will be passed automatically.
