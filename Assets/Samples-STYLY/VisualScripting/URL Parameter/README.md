## Get URL Parameter Sample

This sample demonstrates how to get URL parameters when launching content in the STYLY environment. It uses a simple node structure to show the basic process.

Overview of Features 
* Get the Full URL
  * The Get System Info node is used to retrieve the entire URL specified at the time the content is launched by accessing the key URL.
* Get URL Parameters
  * The Get URL Parameter node is used to specify a key and retrieve the corresponding value from the URL parameters. 
* Testing with Dummy Data
